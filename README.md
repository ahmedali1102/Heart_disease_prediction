# Heart_disease_prediction

## Introduction

▪ A study shows that from 1990 to 2016 the death rate due to 
heart diseases have increased around 34 per cent from 155.7 to 
209.1 deaths per one lakh population in India.

▪ By leveraging existing data and employing supervised learning 
algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees and etc. 

▪ We can effectively train the model to identify patterns and risk 
factors associated with heart disease. Once trained, this model 
can accurately predict the likelihood of individuals developing 
heart disease based on their unique characteristics and medical 
histor

## Problem Description :

It has become increasingly imperative to prevent heart diseases. 
Effective data-driven systems for predicting such conditions can 
significantly enhance research and prevention efforts, thereby 
ensuring that a greater number of individuals can enjoy healthier 
lives. This is where the application of Machine Learning 
becomes essential. Machine Learning facilitates accurate 
predictions of heart diseases, thereby playing a crucial role in 
proactive healthcare interventions

## Dataset :
The dataset consists of 779 individuals data. There are 15 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 14 columns.

Age : displays the age of the individual.
Sex : displays the gender of the individual using the following format : 1 = male 0 = female.
Chest-pain type : displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format : 1 = typical angina 2 = atypical angina 3 = non - anginal pain 4 = asymptotic
Resting Blood Pressure : displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
Serum Cholestrol : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)
Fasting Blood Sugar : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 (true) else : 0 (false)
Resting ECG : 0 = normal 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
Max heart rate achieved : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
Exercise induced angina : 1 = yes 0 = no
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest : displays the value which is integer or float.
Peak exercise ST segment : 1 = upsloping 2 = flat 3 = downsloping
Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
Thal : displays the thalassemia : 3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversable defect
Diagnosis of heart disease : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 0 = absence 1,2,3,4 = present.
